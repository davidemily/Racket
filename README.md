## Learning Racket
I made this project to experiment with the Racket programming language.

#### What is Racket?
Racket is a "general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family." ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)](https://en.wikiedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)))

#### Why Racket?
What drew me to trying Racker is how easy it is to pickup! The programming language comes with its own compiler, supports closs-platform, and is open-source. In addition, the language is constantly being updated by a group of universities called the ["PLT"](https://racket-lang.org/people.html).
This group of Universities that include Northeaster, Utah, Indiana, Brown, and many more, work hard to make the language easier, more efficient and more enjoyable to program in.
The language can be used as a functional or procedural programming language, supports OOP, and has a constantly-growing number of frameworks. If you're not happy with the language, you can even make your own using Racket!

#### Where can I start using Racket?
Everything you'd ever need can be found at [racket-lang.org](https://racket-lang.org/)! The site holds downloads for the language, the IDE, packages, and all of the free books and documentation you could ever want.
