## Learning Racket
I made this project to experiment with the Racket programming language.

Racket is a "general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family." ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)))
